I’m Arezki Cherfouh, a student developer and founder & CEO of Qwerify, a communication platform I built from the ground up in July 19 2025 to rethink how people connect online.
Born in September 07 2009 and passionate about AI.
I specialize in Python, JavaScript, FastAPI, Node.js, SQL (PostgreSQL) and HTML/CSS, with growing experience in system design and AI. Through Qwerify, I’ve gained hands-on expertise in developing full-stack applications, implementing real-time communication, handling authentication, and preparing infrastructure for scalability.

My long-term mission is to become a world-class software engineer and later scale Qwerify into a global platform that rivals today’s biggest tech companies — with a focus on innovation, privacy, and user empowerment.

Currently, I’m focused on:

Strengthening my knowledge in data structures, algorithms, and system design for big tech opportunities

Expanding Qwerify with AI features, mobile development, and video/voice communication

Building a professional portfolio on GitHub and growing my network of engineers and innovators

Always open to connecting with developers, founders, and recruiters who share the vision of building the future of technology.
