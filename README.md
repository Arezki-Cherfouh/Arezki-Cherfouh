I’m Arezki Cherfouh, a student developer and the Founder & CEO of Qwerify, an independent tech project I started on July 19 2025 to rethink how people connect and interact through technology.
Born on September 07 2009 and passionate about AI and innovation.

Qwerify is currently in development — not yet a registered company — but it represents my long-term vision of building a global technology brand that expands beyond communication into AI-driven systems, productivity tools, and scalable digital experiences that help people without distraction.

I specialize in Python, JavaScript, FastAPI, Node.js, SQL (PostgreSQL), ReactJS/React Native and HTML/CSS and Tailwind CSS & Bootstrap, with growing experience in system design and AI. Through Qwerify, I’ve gained practical experience in full-stack development, real-time communication, secure authentication, and infrastructure scalability.

My long-term goal is to become a world-class AI engineer and CEO, and to grow Qwerify into a global company that competes with leading tech innovators — guided by the principles of privacy, focus, and human-centered design.

Currently, I’m focused on:
• Strengthening my knowledge in data structures, algorithms, and system design for big tech opportunities
• Expanding Qwerify with AI features, mobile development
• Building a professional portfolio on GitHub and connecting with engineers, founders, and innovators worldwide

Always open to collaborating with those who share the vision of creating technology that empowers people — not distracts them.
